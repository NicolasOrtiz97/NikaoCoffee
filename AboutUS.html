    <p class="tity21">OUR BEGINNINGS</p>
    <p class="intro41"><b> NIKAO COFFEE SERVICES was created with the desire to share our love for the coffee world.</b> 
        We are a Colombian family run business, our story begins in our country, we grew up among the coffee crops in the Eje Cafetero area between the Quindío and Risaralda mountains, living all the grain process from the planting, the harvest, the drying and the milling. We know what’s coffee about not only the beverage but the great work behind each cup.
        </p>

<div style="    position: relative;top: 73px;height: 505px;">
    <p class="tity31">THE OPPORTUNITY</p>
    <p class="intro51">We moved to UK in the first decade of 2000 and we kept working in coffee industry related jobs such as cafes and coffee shops, during that time we had our first contact with the espresso machines and its accessories and we discover an opportunity to work on.
        We realized coffee appliances maintenance was a very important part in the business, a correct and often machine service helps to maximize their working lives, whilst also preserving the taste and properties of all the hot drinks that are made with them.
        That’s how we decided to start working in a coffee services company, we learnt how to strip down an espresso machine and make a full maintenance by removing, adjusting, fixing and restoring each part. Also we acquire a huge knowledge about grain properties and characteristics, the coffee roastery and its delivery.
        After working for more than 8 years in this company and almost more than the half of our lives living close to the coffee we decide to <b> start out our entrepreneurship focus in the whole coffee experience for business.</b> 
        </p>
