        <p class="intro1">Coffee machines are sophisticated equipment with a high number of parts, so it should come as no surprise that regular scheduled maintenance can be needed to prevent issues related to wear and tear of the inner pieces. 
            Due to the nature of making coffee, we highly recommend that all coffee machines are serviced at least once a year. This helps maximize their working lives, whilst also preserving the taste and properties of all the hot drinks you can make in the device. By having regular coffee maintenance service, you can reduce the chance of breakdowns and minimize costly periods of downtime in the future.

        <p class="texc2">At <b> NIKAO COFFEE SERVICES</b> we take water seriously, whether your focus is brewed coffee or espresso, we can help you choose the right water filter and replacement program for your machines. <br> <br> 
            Even if you have the best roasted beans, your end product will suffer without properly filtered water. You probably didn’t realize that it’s been scientifically proven that the better the quality of water to make hot drinks, the better the taste, so it’s important to make sure that it’s as clean and as clear as possible. Remember that using a water filter in perfect condition ensures that the water used by your coffee machine, no matter the type, is of optimum quality with no impurities to ruin your hot drinks.
